Assignment two  Introduction to Software engineering 

Define Software Engineering:
software engineering is an engineering discpline that involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems by applying engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It applies engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build robust and reliable software solutions.
It differs from traditional programming in that, traditonal programing involves writing code only that  is programmers create functional code that allows software to perform specific tasks.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
This is a structured process used for developing software applications and involves a step by step process.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
>1. Planning -To determine the scope and purpose of the project.
>2. Analyzing of requirements - Understand user needs, system requirements, and constraints.
>3. Designing - Creating system architecture, detailed designs, and user interfaces.
>4. Implementation (Code writing) -  To develop the actual software.
>5. Testing - to verify and ensure the software is free of defects and meets requirements.
>6. Deployment - To release the software to users.
>7. Regular maintenance - ensuring the software continues to function correctly and meets user needs.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Waterfall is a SDLC model that follows a linear and sequential process with well-defined stages.
Agile Model is a SDLC model that emphasizes on flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative progress through
 short development cycles (sprints).

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, 
and in what scenarios might each be preferred
Key differences
Waterfall method is sequential and Linear that is each phase must be completed before the next begins. Once a phase 
is finished, it is typically not revisited while an agile model is iterative and incremental that is development
 is broken down into small, manageable chunks called iterations or sprints, each delivering a potentially
shippable product increment.

What is requirements engineering? 
Requirements engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to defining, documenting, and maintaining the 
requirements for a software system.
Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
The process
>Feasibility Study that is analyzing technical, operational, and economic aspects to determine if the project is viable.
>Requirements Elicitation by gathering functional and non-functional requirements from stakeholders through interviews, 
workshops, and surveys.
>Requirements Specification by documenting requirements in detail.
>Requirements Verification and Validation to ensure requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.
>Requirements Management by tracking changes, maintains traceability, and handles evolving requirements.
importance
Sets the groundwork for the entire project.
Helps identify risks early.
Facilitates collaboration among stakeholders.
Ensures the software meets user expectations.
Prevents rework and scope creep thus saving on Cost and Time Efficiency.

Software Design Principles:
These are guidelines that help software engineers create software systems that are robust, maintainable, and scalable.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software
 systems?
 Modularity in Software Design is the design principle of dividing a software system into separate, self-contained units 
 called modules where each module encapsulates a specific piece of functionality and can be developed,
 tested, and maintained independently from the rest of the system.
 It improves maintainability and scalability by simplified understanding that is developers can focus on a single 
 module at a time, thus simplifying the process of understanding and working on the code and different teams can work 
 on different modules simultaneously, speeding up the development process and allowing for more efficient use of resources.

 Testing in Software Engineering:
 Software testing is a process in software development lifecycle that involves verifying and validating software applications 
  to ensure they meet specified requirements, are free of defects, and perform effectively.

  Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance 
  testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested
   in isolation inorder to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.
Integration testing is a software testing technique where multiple parts of a software system are tested together as a
    group to ensure that the integrated components function seamlessly.
System Testing is a software testing technique where a complete, integrated system is tested to verify that it meets
  the specified requirements and is normally conducted on the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is a level of software testing where the system is tested for acceptability to ensure and evaluate
 the system’s compliance with the business requirements and to assess whether it is ready for delivery. 
it is crucial since it ensures that software meets quality standards, functions correctly, and adheres to requirements.
It ensures that the software meets security standards and complies with relevant regulations.
It helps in identifying defects early in the development cycle which is less expensive than
 fixing them after the software has been deployed.
 It verifies that the software aligns with user needs and business goals.
 It ensures software quality from the start thus reduces the need for extensive future maintenance and modifications.

 Version Control Systems:
 Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time and they allow multiple 
 developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, and collaborate efficiently. 

 What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
 Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

 They are important since :
 >They enable efficient communication among developers, tracking who made changes and what those changes were.
 >It keeps source code organized and improves productivity.
 >They are Traceable thus helps prevent conflicts and errors during project development.
 >In case of disasters, VCS ensures recovery by maintaining historical versions.

 Examples:
 Git, Helix Core and Microsoft TFS.

 Software Project Management:
 Software Project Management is the process of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling software projects and it 
 involves applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet project requirements and achieve project goals.
 
 Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges 
 faced in managing software projects?
 >Project Planning and Scheduling by defining project scope, objectives, and deliverables.
 >Resource Management by identifying and allocating necessary resources, including personnel, equipment, and budget.
 >Budget Management by estimating project costs and develop a budget.
 >Identifying potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
 >Ensuring that the project meets quality standards and requirements.
challenges
>Uncontrolled expansion of project scope.
>Adapting to evolving client needs.
>Balancing limited resources (time, budget, personnel).
>Handling intricate software design and development.
>Managing diverse expectations.

Software Maintenance:
Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial deployment. 
inorder to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt the software to a changed environment.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. 
Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Corrective Maintenance:
Fixing defects (bugs) reported by users or discovered during testing and addressing issues related 
to functionality, performance, or security.
Adaptive Maintenance:
Adapting software to changes in the environment (e.g., OS upgrades, hardware changes) to ensure compatibility 
with new technologies.
Perfective Maintenance:
Enhancing software to improve its quality, efficiency, or user experience.
Adding new features or optimizing existing ones.
Preventive Maintenance:
Proactively identifying and addressing potential issues.
Regularly reviewing code and documentation.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?How can software engineers ensure they 
 adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 Data Privacy:
Ensuring user data is handled securely and transparently.
Avoiding unauthorized data collection or sharing.
Algorithmic Bias:
Addressing biases in algorithms that can lead to unfair outcomes.
Regularly auditing and refining models to minimize bias.
Accessibility:
Designing software that accommodates diverse users (e.g., disabilities, language barriers).
Prioritizing inclusivity and equal access.
Software Security:
